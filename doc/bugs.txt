Some bugs found during development:
  * Primary and Inter event classes do not check if a newly added parent is
    not a primary event. This is currently being tested by FaultTree class
    upon input processing and initialization of the fault tree.
  * Types of events and gates are checked in FaultTree class but not in Event
    classes, which may seem more intuitive.

Minor issues:
  * MCombineElSet is the same as CombineElSet.
